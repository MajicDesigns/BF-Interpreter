# BrainF**k on Arduino

These sketches are implementations of BF on the Arduino.

BF is an extremely minimalist programming language created in 1993. The language consists of eight simple single letter commands (><+-.,[]) and an instruction pointer. It is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.
